In university sports settings, coaches often struggle with evaluating and comparing athletes accurately due to the lack of an objective, data-driven system. Traditional methods depend heavily on observation and subjective judgment, which can lead to inconsistencies and missed opportunities for performance improvement. There is also no intelligent system in place to simulate or automate decision-making processes.

This project operates in the domain of Sports Analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) and aims to solve these issues using machine learning. The core objective is to provide a smarter way to predict player performance workflows using AI.
